# RS Microsequencer Implementation
This code was produced as part of a univeristy group project in which the task was to implement the RS CPU as described by Carpinelli in his [book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Computer-Systems-Organization-Architecture-United/dp/0201612534/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1525965130&sr=1-1&refinements=p_27%3AJohn+Carpinelli). 

This was demonstrated on a [DE2 board](https://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?No=30) using it's seven segment displays to show the contents of various registers and control unit states. 

From memory it also used the RAM chip on the board but it looks like I didn't include that code. 

This code has since been 'pruned' where I attempted to remove unused files and change the names etc so there may be build errors present. 

## What it does
See the [microcode](control_unit/microcode.vhd).

## Future Work
There are no plans to update this or even make sure it still builds. But I might do it? We'll see!
